    "A game of blackjack requires 52 to 416 cards. For simplicity, 52 cards are all we are gonna deal in or consider. The suits are namely: Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs. The goal of the game is to reach 21, and not beyond. The player can either hit or stand. So, basically it has other rules as well, which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack)"
